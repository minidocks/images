[LFTP](https://lftp.yar.ru) is a sophisticated file transfer program supporting a number of network protocols (ftp, http, sftp, fish, torrent).
Like BASH, it has job control and uses the readline library for input. It has bookmarks, a built-in mirror command, and
can transfer several files in parallel. It was designed with reliability in mind.
